SimpleERDiag
========
The goal of this project is to provide simple Entity-Relationship diagram editor, which uses Crow's Foot notation.

All the images are produced by myself, unless stated otherwise (which explains their poor quality, as I'm not an artist).
Good news is that these can be easily replaced later, should there be need.
